Sebastien hails from Annecy FRANCE. He has earned degrees from the University of Annecy. While his work focuses on Infrastructure as Code, mostly optimizing processes of both the deployment and the delivery, his non-work interests range widely, everything from flying robots to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!

## EMPLOYMENT

### *Senior Systems Engineer / DevOps*,  (2017-01 — 2018-03)

EagleEye is a SaaS platform that allows retailers and other businesses to create an intelligent, real-time connection with their customers. The latest addition to our portfolio is the PCOptimum loyalty program which effectively merged both Optimum and PCplus. As a Senior Systems Engineer, my duties started with infrastructure as code using Chef, for monitoring and provisioning of the many different systems that compose our platform. I led and documented the deployment of our private cloud stack federated across three locations using highly redundant design. I help to bring us closer to continuous integration by talking with Dev Teams to understand their needs and closely working with the Architects to come up with practical and functional DevOps' workflows using existing internal tools and DevOps tools. I am involved in load and stress testing or to troubleshoot performance issues at network, operating system or application level. The daily stuff includes monitorings systems, dealing with incoming support requests, lead and/or participate support bridges and PT sessions. I also maintain our internal systems from firewall appliances, load balancers, and storage to 3rd party services integrations. One of the biggest contribution this far was the introduction of Jenkins and Ansible along with Consul and Vault. This allows EagleEye to deploy, scale and secure any on-premise or cloud data center with very little operational overhead.
